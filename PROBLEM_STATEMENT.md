# Lightelligence RTL Interview Question

## Overview
In this problem, we are looking for you to design and implement a streaming ALU for unsigned 8-bit integers.
We've provided stubs for the functional blocks that comprise the ALU. Your task is to connect them with the appropriate muxing to create an ALU that handles the following unsigned 8-bit integer operations:

 - Add
 - Subtract
 - Multiply
 - Divide
 - Multiply-Accumulate

alu.sv is provided with a basic interface but is otherwise left-blank for you to fill in.
Since only stubs are provide for the functional blocks, you are not expected to functionally verify your design with a testbench.
We are looking for a general sense of your skills in the following areas:

 - Digital design
 - Ability to transform requirements into a maintainable and performant solution
 - RTL code quality

Please write-down all assumptions and questions you have. If your assumptions can be codified as assertions, please put them in your solution.

In addition to writing RTL to implement the ALU, please write brief responses to each of the questions in the other markdown file.

We like to read good code and insightful analysis, but we also don't expect candidates to spend more than two hours on this problem.
Our goal is to get a better idea of how you write code and how you think about the implications of your RTL.
