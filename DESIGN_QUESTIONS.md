# Design Questions
 - What are your initial thoughts on power, timing, performance and area?
 - How does your solution scale with the addition of new functional units or the modification of the underlying data type? How could you support multiple data types?
 - What would you suggest to a DV engineer verifying this block?
 - Is your solution maintainable? How does your code read to someone who isn't familiar with the design?
 - What tools and hooks would you need to debug this design in a post-silicon environment?
